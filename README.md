## What is this book about?
Augmented Reality allows for radical innovations in countless areas. It magically blends the physical and virtual worlds, bringing applications from a screen into your hands. Meanwhile, Unity has now become the leading platform to develop augmented reality experiences, as it provides a great pipeline for working with 3D assets.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build and run AR applications for specific headsets, including HoloLens and Daydream
* Create 3D scenes with Unity and other 3D tools while learning about world space and scale
* Move around your AR scenes using locomotion and teleportation
* Create filters or overlays that work in tandem with facial recognition software
* Use GPS, geolocation services, and the camera feed to create a fitness application
